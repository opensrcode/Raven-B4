overpriced $125 forge mod by some major geek ass nigga who camps webhook logs all day. none of its modules bypass on watchdog so you need to rely solely on its scripting api.

it is also a pyramid scheme perpetuated by the fact that users realize they have wasted $125 and need to refer other users to recoup money from their retarded purchase.

[ how-to ]

download the crack here, put jar in mods (forge 1.8.9)

you may get a firewall prompt as it launches a local server on port 1337 to respond to raven's loader/auth requests

IMPORTANT: make sure you're using a version of openjdk 8 such as corretto 8 or adoptium 8 (tested on these). oracle jdk will NOT work nor will any JRE's
